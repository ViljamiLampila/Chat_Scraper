# Chat_Scraper
Simple script that scrapes live twitch chat and writes it ontoa file then parses it to a json

Small scraper that im working on right now.
```
FUNCTIONS{

 READY{
	
  Read online chat.
  
  Dump it into a text file.
  
  Parse text file to a nice list in chatters.json.
 }	
 
	
 TO DO{
	
  insert date time, username, channel, message into databse.
  
  Do some function example: who chatted the most?, wich emote was most used, and so on.
  
 }	
 
	
}
```

might expand the idea?
